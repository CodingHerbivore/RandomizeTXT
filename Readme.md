# RandomizeTxt

This little utility takes a notepad or other text editor created TXT file with a comma-separated list and randomly rearranges that list.

For example:

Foo, bar, 123

Could become:

bar, Foo, 123

Or:

123, bar, Foo

That's it. Really, that's all it does. It saves the randomized list to a new text file. I just needed it for one little project.
